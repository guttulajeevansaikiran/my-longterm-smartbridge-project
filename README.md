A Full Stack House Rental Web Application built using React and Express.js that allows users to register, login, view properties, add properties, and book houses.
✅ Step 1: Install Required Software

First, install Visual Studio Code for writing and managing the project files.
Next, install Node.js, which is required to run JavaScript outside the browser and manage packages using npm.

After installation, ensure both are properly set up on your system.

✅ Step 2: Install Important VS Code Extensions

To improve productivity and maintain clean code, install the following extensions in VS Code:

ES7+ React Snippets (for faster React development)

Prettier (for automatic code formatting)

ESLint (for identifying coding issues)

Thunder Client (for testing backend APIs)

These tools help maintain professional coding standards.

✅ Step 3: Create Project Folder Structure

Create a main project folder named House Rental Management System.

Inside it, create two separate folders:

Frontend

Backend

This separation ensures clean full-stack architecture and better maintainability.

✅ Step 4: Setup Frontend Application

Initialize a React application inside the frontend folder.

After setup:

Install necessary dependencies such as routing and HTTP request libraries.

Configure React Router to manage navigation between pages.

Create required components such as:

Register Page

Login Page

Properties Page

Add Property Page

Navigation Bar

Apply Bootstrap styling to ensure a responsive and professional user interface.

The frontend will run in the browser and handle all user interactions.

✅ Step 5: Setup Backend Server

Inside the backend folder:

Initialize a Node.js project.

Install Express framework to create the server.

Install CORS to allow frontend and backend communication.

Create the following structure:

Main server file

Authentication routes

Booking routes

The backend will handle:

User registration

User login validation

Property booking requests

Sending responses to frontend

✅ Step 6: Connect Frontend and Backend

Configure API calls from the frontend to communicate with the backend server.

Ensure:

Proper request handling

JSON data exchange

Error handling

Clear response messages

This establishes full-stack integration.

✅ Step 7: Test the Application

Test the following functionalities:

User Registration

User Login

View Properties

Add Property

Book Property

Retrieve Booking Details

Use API testing tools to verify backend responses.

✅ Step 8: Optimize Project Structure

Organize the project with:

Modular route handling

Clean component structure

Proper naming conventions

Reusable components

This improves scalability and maintainability.

✅ Step 9: Add Version Control

Initialize Git in the project folder.

Add a proper .gitignore file

Avoid uploading node_modules

Push the project to GitHub repository

This ensures professional version control management.

✅ Step 10: Future Improvements

To enhance the project further:

Integrate a database for permanent storage

Implement JWT-based authentication

Add password encryption

Deploy the application to cloud platforms

🎯 Final Outcome

By following these steps, you will build a full-stack House Rental Web Application demonstrating:

Frontend development using React

Backend development using Express

API integration

Routing

Modular architecture

Professional project structuring
